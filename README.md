#Wasting Time

##Objectives

Analyzing how Americans use their time by utilizing the U.S. Department of Labor's data.

##Skills Required

Understanding how to analyze public data.
Understand how to use public data for analysis.
Understand how to translate data from CSVs to pandas DataFrames.
Understand how to publish your own data analysis as a notebook.
Be able to use pandas to parse and analyze data.
Be able to use matplotlib to chart data.
Be able to clean data.

##Deliverables

A Git repo named atus-analysis containing at least:
A README.md file with a description and explanation of how to run your project
A requirements.txt file
A Jupyter notebook with your analysis
A suite of tests for your project

#Synopsis

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes yearly data about Americans' use of their time: American Time Use Survey.

This data is used to find out information like how many hours the average person spends per day doing household activities. You can see the 2014 survey results for more examples. Use these results to double-check your logic as well.

You will download the 2014 files and use these to do analysis. The questions you are trying to answer are up to you, but they need to at least:

Compare different populations (people with children and people without, people of differing age groups, men and women, or other groupings)

Answer macro-level questions and micro-level questions (for example, the amount of leisure for the macro-level, the types of things people do for leisure for the micro-level)
Your final analysis must be in the form of a Jupyter Notebook with both narrative analysis and supporting charts. Any supporting code needs to be in normal Python files.


#User Guide

Use the Jupyter notebook guidepoints to follow the data. You will see graphs that analyze various data points such as male/female population counts and daily work allocations (in minutes) amongst various groups, demarcated on such fields as sex, education-level, and age.
